CloudSnap: A Serverless Image Storage System with Tagging


This work aims to build a cloud-based online system that allows users to store and retrieve images based on auto-generated tags. The focus of this project is to design a serverless application that enables clients to upload their images to public cloud storage. Upon image upload, the application automatically tags the image with the objects detected in it, such as person, car, etc. Later on, clients can query images based on the objects present in them. To achieve this, the application provides users with a list of image URLs (or tumbnails) that include the specific queried objects.
